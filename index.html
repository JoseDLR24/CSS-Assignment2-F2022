          <h3><b>Synopsis</b></h3>
          <p>The 5AM Club presents a powerful argument for a work-rest routine to join the top 5% of performers. In the form of a story, the book argues that a structured and consistent morning routine which starts at 5AM can act as a catalyst for greater productivity, health, and happiness. Sharma also puts forward a variety of tactics for our working days to capitalise on our strong morning start, along with some fundamental principles for world-class performance.</p>
